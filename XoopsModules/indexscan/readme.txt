Why use index.html files ?

Unless the webmaster disallows casual folder browsing on the web server, most of the contents of each folder can be listed in a browser pointing to that Internet address. This concept is easily demonstrable by typing most any website address into the address bar of an Internet browser and simply adding a forward-slash and this folder name to the address:

images

If the images folder of the website navigated to is not protected, a listing of all the files in the folder will be displayed. Any of the files in the resulting display may be right-clicked on and the 'save as' option taken in order to save that file to a hard drive. In most cases websites will have an images folder, and this folder will not ususually be protected from casual browsing. If so, the entire contents of the images folder will be accessible to the public at large.

Depending upon file types, the files in an unprotected web folder may or may not be accessible; .php, .asp, and .aspx files are not accessible although .gif, .jpg, .bmp, .png, and other image files are fully accessible. Additionally, without folder protection in place, a hacker can make use of configuration files as well, such as config.inc and that could be where the websites database connection strings are held! Therefore, the database itself could become compromised.

 This is a small module to scan your server folders for missing index.html files. If missing you can create.
 
 The module obviously does not have a place in the frontpage main menu, but can only be accessed through administration as admin.
 
 The module is testet with FF, Opera, and IE8 and checks out fine with all.
 
 Should you discover any errors or is it not operating as intented please send email to culex@culex.dk.
 ....

The modules scans your webfolders for missing index.html files. It skips folders where there are already indexfiles (index.php, index.html, index.html). If you find folders without you can automaticly create these by pressing "create index files".

The module looks through the txt in your index.php, index.html, index.htm, mainfile.php, headers and footers for the words iframe or fromCharCode wich is commonly used in coded javascript inserts.

Should it find some occurencies of these words you can yourself check the source code by clicking the red bar emmerging at the line for the file. Do not check the files just because the module finds these words in your pages. Not all uses of iframe and javascript is equal to damaging code and therefor better to check and if in doubt ask for help about what to do with these files.
